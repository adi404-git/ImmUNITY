🧬 ImmUNITY

ImmUNITY is a 2D action-survival game set inside the human bloodstream, where the player fights invading pathogens using movement, timing, and biological combat mechanics.
The project was developed as part of a game development task by WinterOfGameDev (WoG), CGS, with a strong focus on player progression, skill systems, and gameplay feedback.

🎮 Core Gameplay

You play as a microscopic immune defender navigating the bloodstream.
The game emphasizes fluid movement, responsive combat, and gradual power growth rather than overwhelming difficulty spikes.

Controls

Movement: WASD / Movement Input

Aim: Mouse

Shoot Antibodies: Left Mouse Button

Dash: Dash Input (quick repositioning & impact attacks)

Pause: ESC

🧠 Progression & Upgrade System (Main Design Focus)

This project was intentionally designed around meaningful player progression.

Implemented Systems

XP Gain: Enemies grant experience on defeat

Level System: Increasing XP requirements per level

Upgrade Selection UI:

Movement improvements

Attack enhancements

Dash-based upgrades

Visual Feedback: Particle effects and UI updates on level-up

These systems ensure that every encounter contributes to long-term strength, rewarding both skill and persistence.

🦠 Enemies & Combat

Multiple enemy types with distinct movement and damage behavior

Physics-based knockback and collision reactions

Dash-based combat interactions

A multi-phase boss enemy inspired by biological resistance mechanisms

🧩 Game Systems

🎨 Visuals & Assets

Developed in Unity (2D)

Uses Unity’s New Input System

All sprites and visual assets generated using NanoBanana, focused on bio-inspired and organic design

📚 Learning & Credits

This project was a learning-focused build, not a commercial product.

ChatGPT (OpenAI) and Gemini Pro (Google) were used as learning and debugging aids — especially for:

Understanding complex logic

Fixing system-level bugs

Refining gameplay systems beyond basic tutorials

Special thanks to WoG seniors for mentoring and teaching fundamental game development concepts.

Thanks to CGS for providing the opportunity, structure, and creative freedom to explore game development through this project.

🚧 Project Status

ImmUNITY is an ongoing learning project.
Future improvements may include better enemy behaviors, animation polish, and additional visual feedback.
